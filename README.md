# LinearSolver
A Python GUI for solving linear equations using Gaussian Elimination. Displays step-by-step solutions with an interactive Tkinter interface.
A Python-based tool for solving systems of linear equations using Gaussian Elimination, featuring a Tkinter GUI for user-friendly interaction. This project was developed as part of a Linear Algebra course to demonstrate the step-by-step solution process.

Features:
Supports Gaussian Elimination with step-by-step output.
Interactive Tkinter GUI for easy input and visualization.
Handles cases with unique solutions, infinite solutions, or no solution.
Displays the augmented matrix transformation at each step.
Usage:
Enter the number of rows (equations) and columns (variables).
Input the coefficients matrix along with the constants.
Click "Solve" to get the solution with all intermediate steps.
